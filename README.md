# World countries hangman game


## Project overview
Project 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Essentials.

The theme for this Hangman game is Countries of the World.

Hangman is an age-old guessing game, traditionally played as a paper and pencil game for two or more players but easily adaptable to an electronic game for one plater. Players can try to guess the word by inputting letters until they either guess the word or it is game over. Players can play the game on three difficulties. Either Easy with 10 lives, Normal with 7 lives, and Hard with 5 lives. 

## How to Play
In this Hangman game players aim to guess the hidden name of a country. The country is represented by a series of dashes, each representing one letter in the country name. 

The player inputs a letter into the terminal, if the letter appears in the country name the corresponding dash will be replaced with the letter. If the letter does not appear they will lose a life. Players continue to enter letters until they correctly guess the country name or until they have exhausted all their lives.
